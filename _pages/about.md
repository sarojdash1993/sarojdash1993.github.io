## Bio
I am a Post-doctoral researcher at University of California, Davis, working in the multidisciplinary plant processes in the Crop Sensing group [T-Rex Team](https://www.t-rexproject.com/meet-the-team). My research here inclined towards the stability of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration processes and their sensitivity to crop water stress over the almond and grapevine orchards in California's central valley. Using an extensive datasets from the Eddy Covariance towers along with remote sensing based plant and soil water fluxes, I interplay the threshold of these processes by utilizing numerous modelling tools and techniques.
