I am a Post-doctoral researcher at University of California, Davis, working in the multidisciplinary plant processes in the Crop Sensing group [T-Rex Team] (https://www.t-rexproject.com/meet-the-team). My research here focuses on the stability of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration processes and their sensitivity to crop water stress over the alomond and grapevines orchards in California's central valley.
